Jialin Dong is a Ph.D. student of Environmental ENgineering at the UCI Olivares Lab. My research interests chemical and biological in-situ remediation of sites polluted with ‘forever chemicals’ per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) with Data Mining Methods, especially Machine Learning.  

董家麟是加州大学尔湾分校2021级的博士学生。我的研究兴趣是使用数据挖掘方法，尤其是机器学习，对被“永久化学品”全氟和多氟烷基物质 (PFAS) 污染的场地进行化学和生物原位修复。
